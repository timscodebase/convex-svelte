# Sveltekit + Convex Demo

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
pnpm create svelte@latest svelte-convex-demo
cd svelte-convex-demo
pnpm install
```

Add Convex to your project:

```bash
pnpm add convex
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npx convex dev
pnpm run dev
```
